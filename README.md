=================

A team-based game mode.

One team has infinite respawns, the other spawns only once.

Played on LTS or TDM maps, though tailor-made maps could be done. Note that, rather than swapping players' teams, it changes the game mode's spawn logic to spawn players at the opposing team's spawn points; therefore, it can't be used on any maps with Kismet or other features that rely on certain teams being in certain places. I'm not right now whether any such maps exist, but I figured I'd mention it. Can be played online, or offline with bots.

Takes LTS, then overrides ChoosePlayerStart, Scoring, EndRound, and other bits to accomplish what it needs.

=================

As always, you can use any part of this *for other Chivalry mods*.
